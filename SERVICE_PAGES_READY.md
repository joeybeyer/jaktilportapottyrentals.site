## Wedding Planning Tips

**When to Book**  
Book 2-3 months ahead for wedding season (March-November). Luxury trailers book earliest—don't wait. October is peak wedding season in Texas due to cooler weather.

**Placement**  
- Keep restrooms accessible but discreet
- Away from food service and dance floor
- Well-lit path for evening events
- Consider shade for standard units
- Consider separate bridal suite restroom

**Timing**  
- Delivery 2-4 hours before ceremony
- Pickup morning after (or specify time)

**Coordination**  
We work with your wedding planner, venue coordinator, and other vendors to ensure smooth logistics.

- Wimberley ranches and B&Bs
- Fredericksburg vineyards
- Lake Travis waterfront estates
- Austin urban venues
- Georgetown historic venues

---

## Texas Wedding Considerations

**The Heat Reality**  
Texas weddings, especially spring through fall, mean heat. Consider:
- Luxury trailers with AC for guest comfort
- More units than usual (heat = more bathroom trips)
- Shaded placement for standard units

**The Distance Factor**  
Many beautiful Hill Country venues are remote. We serve:
- Venues up to 100 miles from Austin
- Properties without utilities (we bring generators & water)
- Difficult access locations (we'll assess beforehand)

---

## Make It Yours

**Optional enhancements:**

- Fresh flowers in trailers
- Custom signage
- Attendant service
- Emergency kit stocking
- Extended rental hours

---

## Wedding Restroom FAQ

**Will porta potties ruin our wedding photos?**  
Strategic placement keeps units out of sight. Luxury trailers actually photograph beautifully and can be decorated.

**What if it's 100 degrees on our wedding day?**  
This is Texas—it might be! Luxury trailers have AC. For standard units, we recommend shaded placement and more units than usual.

**Can guests use the restrooms during the ceremony?**  
Yes! Having restrooms available reduces ceremony interruptions.

**Do you work with wedding planners?**  
Absolutely. We coordinate directly with your planner for seamless delivery and placement.
